Description: A statistical method for quality control that detects changes in
    performance as reaction time increases to generate a cutoff reaction time past
    which accuracy is above chance. Trials are sorted in order from fastest to
    slowest reaction time, the EWMA statistic is computed iteratively for each trial
    and compared to the upper control limit for that trial. If the EWMA statistic is
    less than the upper control limit, then the accuracy for that trial is at chance
    and it can be considered to be the result of a fast guess. However, if the
    EWMA statistic is greater than the upper control limit, then the probability of
    responding accurately can be concluded to be above chance for that reaction time
    and all slower than it. From Vandekerckhove & Tuerlinckx 2007.
